      <p>Successfully closed deal with the Investor. Time taken to connect: 5 months.</p>

      <q>I was working on my startup idea pre-Covid, but due to lack of funds and the pandemic, we had to shut down our operations. I wanted to sell my business as a shell company that was incorporated as a private limited legal entity. Through some internet research, I came across HUMTMENT, which is an online platform that helps business owners and investors connect. The onboarding process was very smooth. Within the first 2-3 months I received various inquiries. I had an initial discussion with 2 investors before I was able to close a deal. The entire process took 3 months and I was successfully able to sell my company. My experience on the platform was amazing and therefore I would recommend HUMTMENT to any entrepreneur/ business owner who is looking to raise funds or sell their company.</q>

  <p>Successfully closed deal with the 2nd investor. Time taken to connect: 9 months.</p>

<div class="detail">
  <q>At the age of 17, I was a breadwinner, making just 1200 each month. After working in numerous capacities ranging from office boy to area sales manager for various companies for 12 almost years, I decided to start my own customized printing company, GeGa Printz but didn't have the funds to run it. HUMTMENT helped me in obtaining my first round of funding, and now I'm selling franchises in multiple states.</q>

  <p>Successfully closed deal with the 4nd investor. Time taken to connect: 3 months.</p>

<div class="detail">
  <q>I had posted a business for sale on Huntment which was difficult to find a buyer for otherwise due to the size of the deal. Initially, it took a bit of time to start receiving introductions, but I’m glad I was finally able to close the deal with someone. In all, it took 9 months to find a serious buyer and only 2 months to close the deal with him. It’s a genuine site with genuine buyers, that I’m very happy about. None of the investors were fake and were there for serious business interest.</q>
